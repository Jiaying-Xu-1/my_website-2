title: Return comparison of sustainable - and conventional REITs
---

This paper investigates potential abnormal returns globally and among continents in sustainable REIT-industry. While green REITs is a current trend, existing studies are surprisingly outdated. Hence, four sustainable market capitalization-weighted REIT-indices were constructed using monthly time series data of 178 observations ranging from 2003-2017. These were regressed by implementing a newly published Fama and French 5-factor model. In three out of four cases, significant outperformance was found in favour of the sustainable REITs. Nevertheless, the study found that during the financial crisis the Jensenâ€™s alpha disappeared in each case. Overall, the results suggest possible benefits from acting sustainably compared to conventional REITs.
