title: Healthy lifestyle, healthy mind 
---

Exercising and healthy habits have been an integral part of my life since childhood. Currently, I aim to follow the sport routine outlined below: 

**3x gym a week:**
Split 1: Legs
Split 2: Chest and Back
Split 3: Shoulders and Arms

**1-2x Swimming/running a week:**
To maintain a healthy balance between gym and cardio, I aim to swim or run at least once a week also. 

**Cooking:**
Hand in hand with my sporty lifestyle, I have become a passionate cook. My main dishes range from different curries and pastas to more fine-dining. I would be happy to exchange different healthy recipes, so feel free to contact me if you are interested!
