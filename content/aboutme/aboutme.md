title: Introduction - Erkka Salo 
---

Having lived in seven and visited countless other countries, diversity and multiple perspectives have become a norm in my everyday life. Enthusiastic about experiencing different cultures, I constantly aspire to broaden my perception to understand the world slightly better day-by-day.

After two-years of working in the finance industry, I am currently pursuing my Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. In the future, I aim to challenge my skillset in the Investment Banking industry in which I wish to combine the overtime acquired cross-cultural and financial knowledge. Aside from finance, I possess experience from multitude of sectors such as Consulting and Volunteering.

During my leisure time I enjoy socializing by a good drink, do sports, cook as well as read. 

I am a fond fan of connecting with unique people so please do not hesitate to reach out and connect. You can contact me either via LinkedIn or at esalo.mfa2021@London.edu.
